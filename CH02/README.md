# Notes

There are some examples in this chapter that are used to demonstrate errors.  These are not included in this repo.

Where the author used custom include files in an example, they remain but have been commented.  This practice will continue throughout the repo.

The following is often frowned upon, but it is used where necessary to match the author's code

```c++
using namespace std;
```
