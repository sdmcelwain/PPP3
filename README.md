# PPP3

This repo contains unofficial source code for Programming: Principles and Practice Using C++, 3rd Ed. by Bjarne Stroustrup, and it is NOT affilliated with the author or publisher in any way!

The author/publisher have not made source code available and rarely include full code listings in the text.  This code is based, in whole or in part, on selected examples presented in the book; but there is one primary difference:

On page 10 of the book, the author describes his rationale for using various custom headers and a module--essentially, to accomodate compilers that are not up to the c++20/23 standards and to supply various helper functions useful to the reader.  Wherever possible, the source code on this site will avoid using those, and will instead use code that is compatible with c++17 (the default of most modern compilers).  See comments in each file and/or chapter README.

## Updates:

11 December 2024 -- Just getting started on this, and with the holidays coming it is likely there won't be a lot of action until the new year.
